<li>Getting here:
For directions and public transport information see the separate document. Please allow plenty of time for travel, both by car and public transport. Nash Hash coincides with the York Races and the Leeds Festival, both of which will mean roads in the area, particularly the A1 and A64, will be congested and trains will be busier than usual.

Camping is in the sports field. You may access the camping field via the gate marked (see the arrow on the map in the Welcome booklet).
